III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The Supply Agreement:
On March 15, 2023, Sunrise Electronics entered into a supply agreement with Titan Manufacturing for the purchase of electronic components required for their new line of smart televisions. The agreement stipulated quality standards, delivery schedules, and penalties for non-compliance.

Alleged Breach:
Sunrise Electronics alleges that Titan Manufacturing breached the supply agreement by delivering defective electronic components that failed to meet the quality standards outlined in the contract. The plaintiff claims that these defects led to production delays and financial losses.

Defective Goods:
In addition to the breach of contract, Sunrise Electronics contends that the defective components caused malfunctions in the smart televisions, leading to a high rate of product returns and damaging the company’s reputation in the market.

IV. ISSUES PRESENTED

Whether the defective goods caused financial and reputational damage to Sunrise Electronics.

Sunrise Electronics seeks compensatory damages for the losses incurred and reimbursement of additional costs incurred due to the breach.
2. Defendant's Arguments:
